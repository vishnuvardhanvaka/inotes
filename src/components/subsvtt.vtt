00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.970
I feel the end coming four three to one.
All right, we're going to work the upper

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.490
body again, shoulders above the rest.
We're going to take a narrow pushup

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:29.739
and walk into a wide chest, push up.
Come with me just to the floor. Now walk

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:38.349
to the right. Big press, return to the middle.
Come again, other side. So we have

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:46.309
one tricep push up, make sure the elbows
move to the back and here to the outside.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:58.389
Again. Keep breathing and keep the core
engaged. Joe, come on, how many more?

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.829
-Can you make in the remaining time?
-One

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.929
-more, one
-more.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:17.290
All right. Back to standing and back
to legs, everything is shake, we're going

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.919
for lunges and squats in a combination
with a pulse. Watch me right leg behind pulls

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:35.540
one spot in the middle left leg. Keep
your torso upright and your shoulders above

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:49.010
the hips. Yeah, nice posture. Come on.
And try to sink a little deeper, if you can.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:05:05.679
Couple more to go. Make sure. You bet
black has the knee bent, Bent the knee. Last one.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:13.269
All right, give your hands a shake.
Moving on to the high plank.

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:16.339

-ankle. Try to get as far as you can and

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:39.779
bring your hips all the way up to the ceiling.
You can feel everything working

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:52.139
here, the whole body is working.
Just keep going. We're going to be saved

00:05:52.239 --> 00:06:03.350
by the bell soon. But now you have a few
more to go. That's it, saved by the bell,

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:13.339
okay a little rest for the final
exercise. We're going to get to our backs for a nice

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:28.589
hips, stretch. OK, squeeze. Up and down.
Squeeze your butt as hard as

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.820
you can. Full extension of the hips,
you can feel the hamstrings and feel your

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:44.850
booty. Hey, come on, let's go. The final
rounds. This is all there is to it.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:51.299
Just keep going and don't stop
moving. We're going to finish this one together.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.709
